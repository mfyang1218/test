# Original Plugin

This is an example of the plugin here: https://github.com/juliangamble/commit-level-coverage-report


# About

This project enables commit-level coverage reporting.

# Why you would use this


[Workplace with a million line codebase and 100s of developers working on it.]

Tech Lead: "We really want to get the coverage up on this codebase - more tests will give us more feedback about the code."
Developer: "Well that's lovely, but I really need to ship my feature - I'll make sure my stuff is covered as best I can."
Tech Lead: "Ok - how much coverage are you aiming for?"
Developer: "I'll make sure the lines I touch have coverage."
Tech Lead: "Ok - how will you measure that?"
....

Now obviously (a) this codebase is a candidate for modularisation and (b) sonar does give you feedback on coverage at a commit level - but sonar doesn't give you a way to know what the commit-level coverage is prior to pushing your changes. ie - if you've missed some coverage on the lines you've changed - there isn't a way to know before pushing.

This change is trying to solve the problem of knowing "for the lines I have touched - what coverage have I got? What lines have I missed?"


# How to setup and use in your project

Add the following into your `pom.xml`

                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <!-- Optional - sets the path to the file which contains the execution data. -->
                                <!-- <dataFile>${project.build.directory}/coverage-reports/jacoco.exec</dataFile> -->
                                <!-- Sets the output directory for the code coverage report. -->
                                <outputDirectory>${project.reporting.outputDirectory}/</outputDirectory>
                                <daysBackToCheck>100</daysBackToCheck>
                            </configuration>
